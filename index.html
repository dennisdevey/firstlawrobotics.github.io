<p> LAAAAAAMEEEE. We are going to kill the shit out of some human beings. </p>

<p> Q: Dennis, don't you know it is irresponsible to build an open source autonomous death machine? A: Yes. </p>
<p> Q: Why are you doing this then? A: Plenty of other people are, and it's easier to have this debate if there is a very real threat. 
	Also, it seems fun. Everyone needs a hobby.

<h4> <a href="https://github.com/firstlawrobotics/rayCastingMinimap">Raycasting DeadSpace Reward Function Input</a> </h4> 
<p> A fork of a simple raycasting example, I added a miniMap function that identifies cleared space, dead space, and walls and implements a decay function for cleared space to force agents to reprioritize it. </p>
<p> I won't ever do anything with this because I don't have the money to train my reinforcement learning agents so either give me money or fork this. </o>
