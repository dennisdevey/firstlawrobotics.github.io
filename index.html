<p> LAAAAAAMEEEE. We are going to kill the shit out of some human beings. </p>

<p> Q: Dennis, don't you know it is irresponsible to build an autonomous death machine? A: Yes. </p>
<p> Q: Why are you doing this then? A: A few other people are, and it's easier to have this debate if there is a very real threat. 
	Also, it seems fun. Everyone needs a hobby.

<h3><b> Code Releases </b></h3> 
<h4> 03JUN20: <a href="https://github.com/firstlawrobotics/rayCastingMinimap/tree/b31e2f639c3f72e38471ff64d2abd7bc2d31bd24">Real Time Deadspace Heatmap</a> </h4> 
<p> MAde some modifications to the raycasting map, converted the minimap to a heatmap that is refreshed and decays in real time. </p>
<p> I still need money to train this. </p>


<h4> 08DEC19: <a href="https://github.com/firstlawrobotics/rayCastingMinimap/tree/53d48e3aa139b1ce4b3ab7e7c7876685def56411">Raycasting Reward Function</a> </h4> 
<p> A fork of a simple raycasting example, I added a miniMap function that identifies cleared space, dead space, and walls and implements a decay function for cleared space to force agents to reprioritize it. </p>
