	<h2><b> Mission </b></h2>

	<p> Save American lives by replacing conventional combat roles. </p>

<h2> Theory </h2>

<p> Humans driving, carrying, and emplacing robots that operate fully autonmously will be the hallmark of the next 50 years of war. Focusing on local firing-sensor/counter-sensor technology now will enable us to be significantly ahead of what happens next. With overhead EM-defeat UAS, any use of EM spectrum will be responded to with accurate counter-fire. Destroying enemy EM-defeat UAS will be a priority.  </p>

	<h2> Goals </h2>

	<ol>
		<li> Demonstrate a real world CV-aimed firing sensor/counter-sensor pairing, with and without human-in-the-loop</li>
		<li> Generalize the performance of an agent trained with Reinforcement Learning in a First-Person Shooter environment to human level performance in the real world on a stationary platform.  </li>
		<li> Generalize the performance of an agent to human level performance in the real world on a ruck-mounted platform.  </li>
		<li> Remove the need for a human to carry the system around. </li>
</ol>
